# Code-Portfolio
Examples of Python code I've written including school work and personal projects.


Within this directory you'll find a few subdirectories with examples of my code.  These are mostly files I wrote for physics classes in 2020 (one of which was computational physics which was explicitally computer science oriented).  I selected these files because they are relatively recent projects and display some complexity, but mostly because I think the computations, analysis, and data visualizations in each are particularly interesting. Each file includes a short(ish) description of what the overall task of the program is at the beginning.



You'll also find a subdirectory which includes my thoughts, experiences, and experimentation from working through "Introduction to Machine Learning in Python".
I've been interested in machine learning for a few years and educating myself on subjects like neural networks and genetic algorithms.  Recently I've decided to dive in and write and experiment with machine learning programs using IMLP as a guide.
