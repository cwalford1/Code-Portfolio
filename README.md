# Code-Portfolio
Examples of Python code I've written including school work and personal projects.


Within this directory you'll find some examples of my code.  Most of these projects were written for a computational physics class I took this year as this gives them the best mix of recency and complexity to serve as examples of my work.  Each file includes a short description of what the overall task of the program is at the beginning.

You'll also find a sub-directory which includes my thoughts, experiences, and experimentation from working through "Introduction to Machine Learning in Python".
I've been interested in machine learning for a few years and educating myself on subjects like neural networks and genetic algorithms.  Recently I've decided to forier
